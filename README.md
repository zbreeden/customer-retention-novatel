# 📉 Customer Retention Strategy – NovaTel Communications

## 📚 Background

Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses. NovaTel Communications, a mid-sized telecom provider, faced increasing competition and declining customer loyalty. Leadership needed a data-driven approach to identify churn drivers, predict risk, and design targeted retention strategies. This project simulates a real-world scenario where data science and business analysis intersect to solve a high-impact business problem.

## 🧠 Business Problem

NovaTel was experiencing rising customer churn across key service segments. The goal of this project is to identify high-risk customers, uncover churn drivers, and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict customer churn using historical data
- Visualize churn trends and key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Apply business analysis techniques to frame stakeholder needs and ROI

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development and stakeholder reporting
- **CBAP Framework**: Stakeholder analysis, business case modeling
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Data manipulation and visualization

## 📈 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Cleaned and transformed customer data using Python (Pandas)  
- Handled missing values, normalized formats, and encoded categorical variables  
- Engineered features such as tenure, usage patterns, and support interactions

### 2. Modeling  
- Built a logistic regression model to classify churn risk  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
- Tuned hyperparameters and validated results with cross-validation

### 3. Business Framing  
- Conducted stakeholder analysis using CBAP techniques  
- Modeled ROI scenarios for retention interventions  
- Identified cost-benefit thresholds for campaign targeting

### 4. Visualization  
- Developed Power BI dashboard to present churn trends, risk segments, and retention KPIs  
- Dashboard includes filters by region, plan type, and tenure group  
- Designed layout for executive readability and drill-down capability
